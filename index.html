    		<p>Hello, I'm Sydney Harter. I'm passionate about HTML and web development. I love creating visually stunning websites that work seamlessly across devices.</p>
	       	<p>Outside of coding, I'm an avid gamer and music enthusiast. Gaming fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills, while music serves as the soundtrack to my life, inspiring me every day.</p>
	        <p>My aspiration in tech is to find a work-at-home job so I can someday be a stay-at-home mom while still providing for my family. I possess prior expertise in remote employment garnered during my tenure in remote customer service roles with Home Depot, where I demonstrated exceptional proficiency and effectiveness. Combining my passions, I strive to bring innovation to everything I do. I'm excited to continue my journey in web development and explore new opportunities.</p>

        	<h3>Bed and Breakfast Website</h3>
        	<p>I created a fully responsive website for a Bed and Breakfast using HTML and Bootstrap. This project involved designing an intuitive user interface that highlights the charm and amenities of the establishment. The site features a photo gallery, room descriptions, booking form, and local attractions, providing potential guests with all the information they need.</p>

    	    <div class="project-box">
            <h3>Class Registration Form</h3>
        	<p>I developed a registration form for selecting classes at Ozarks Technical Community College (OTC). This project focused on creating a user-friendly form with HTML, ensuring that students can easily register for their desired classes. The form includes fields for personal information, course selection, and submission validation.</p>
